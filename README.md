# COMP6441SomethingAwesome

I have used a LOT of different versions of the application (especially as I got further along in the project) just in case I broke something.

As a rough guide I have provided the below timeline that I have just recently created based on my blog posts:
## v0.0: Week 4 - Not possible to tell the work before this due to my laptop issues (before finding a replacement laptop) and also because all work was combined into the one version (NOTE TO SELF... Use Git next time so progress is automatically viewable)
## v0.1.x: Week 5 - Something Awesome Update, browser headers were added to allow websites that didn't want to be "crawled" that this request was from a legitimate brwoser.
## v0.2.x: Week 6 - The program now dumps into an SQLite Database.
## v0.3.x: Week 7 ("final" product) - The program picks up where it has left off due to significant changes of how (and when) the application updates itself.

## NOTE: I have included a "emailAnalysis.py" file although that does not have much functionality as it is just as easy to query the database...
