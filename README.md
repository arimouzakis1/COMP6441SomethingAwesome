# COMP6441SomethingAwesome

I have used a LOT of different versions of the application (especially as I got further along in the project) just in case I broke something.

As a rough guide I have provided the below timeline that I have just recently created based on my blog posts:
### Week 4 (v0.0) - Not possible to differentiate the work before this (due to my laptop issues, before finding a replacement laptop) and also because all work was combined into the one version (NOTE TO SELF... Use Git next time so progress is automatically viewable)
### Week 5 (v0.1.x) - Something Awesome Update, browser headers were added to allow websites that didn't want to be "crawled" that this request was from a legitimate browser.
### Week 6 (v0.2.x) - The program now dumps into an SQLite Database.
### Week 7 (v0.3.x - the "final" product) - The program picks up where it has left off due to significant changes of how (and when) the application updates itself.

### NOTE: I have included an "emailAnalysis.py" file although that does not have much functionality as it is just as easy to query the database...
